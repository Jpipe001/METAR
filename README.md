# METAR
+ This code was created for ESP32 to get a group of METARS and display them on :
+ A:  A chain of up to 100 leds (WS2811 or WS2812 or NEOPIXELS), showing the Flight Catorgry with Colors, GREEN, BLUE, RED and MAGENTA plus more.
+ B:  HTML Pages, showing a Summary of the METAR codes and the Invividual Station Display of Decoded Data on a Local Network.

Either or both of the above can be implemented.

End
