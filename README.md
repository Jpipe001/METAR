# METAR
+ In Memory of F. Hugh Magee, brother of John Magee author of poem HIGH FLIGHT.
+ Created by John Pipe with help from David Bird and code from Ros Santos.

This code was created for ESP32 to get a group of METARS and display them on :

+ A:  A chain of up to 100 leds (WS2811 or WS2812 or NEOPIXELS), showing the Flight Catorgry with Colors, GREEN, BLUE, RED and MAGENTA plus more.

+ B:  HTML Pages, showing a Summary of the METAR codes and the Invividual Station Display of Decoded Data on a Local Network.

Either or Both of the above can be implemented.

The number and names of the Stations are Configurable for you application.

+ GETTING DATA : Updates METARS approximately every six minutes, so nearly REAL TIME data, from AVIATIONWEATHER.GOV.

+ WIRING OF LEDS : Three wires to set of WS2812 LEDS.

+ HTML DISPLAYS : Can be accesed by any device connected to a WiFi local network.
